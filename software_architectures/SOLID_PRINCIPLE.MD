# SOLID Principles

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each class should have one responsibility.

## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification.

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
