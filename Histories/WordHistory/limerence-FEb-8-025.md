    <h2>Word of the Day — Limerence</h2>

    <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> A powerful, involuntary romantic obsession toward a specific person, marked by intrusive thoughts, emotional dependency, and a strong need for reciprocation.</p>

    <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Coined in 1979 by psychologist Dorothy Tennov in her book <em>Love and Limerence: The Experience of Being in Love</em>.</p>

    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Limerence is not exactly love — it is closer to psychological fixation. The person feels euphoric when noticed and anxious when ignored. The brain treats small signals (a text, a smile, eye contact) as extremely meaningful.</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Checking your phone repeatedly hoping they replied — that emotional loop is limerence.</p>
